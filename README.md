# Market Analysis

Simple, interactive stock analysis and comparison tool using yfinance and matplotlib.

## Steps to use
1. Type in a ticker
2. Choose the period
3. Decide if you want another ticker to compare
4. The plot gets printed based on your inputs

It's a very concise program, but I had fun putting it together today. Updates may be coming.
